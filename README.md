Relief Chess Prototype
===============

Relief Chess is just another chess variant (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_variant) with unusual rules.
The basic concept of this variant is "relief" that represents ability of a square to constrain movement or position of the specific pieces called "relief subjects".
Currently it only exists as a prototype of web application - HTML+Javascript game for one human player (simulating two players) without AI and real multiplayer support.
